# Ecosystem Status — ArchonVII

_Last updated: 2026-05-31 by Codex_

The canonical "what is the ecosystem doing right now?" document for the four ArchonVII sibling repos. Update this file as part of every ecosystem-wide rollout (step 4 of the playbook below).

## Topology

Four sibling repos under [@ArchonVII](https://github.com/ArchonVII), hub-and-spoke by data flow — no master repo, but `archon-setup` is the integration hub.

- [`ArchonVII/.github`](https://github.com/ArchonVII/.github) — org-level community-health defaults
- [`ArchonVII/github-workflows`](https://github.com/ArchonVII/github-workflows) — reusable workflows pinned at `@v1`
- [`ArchonVII/repo-template`](https://github.com/ArchonVII/repo-template) — passive baseline; `AGENTS.md` is the canonical cross-tool contract
- [`ArchonVII/archon-setup`](https://github.com/ArchonVII/archon-setup) — integration hub. Consumes the other three as read-only snapshots under `src/snapshots/`. Hosts this file.

`archon-setup` is the only consumer; the other three are providers.

## Rollout playbook

Every ecosystem-wide change follows this order. Skip steps that don't apply, but never reorder them.

1. **Provider repo PRs.** Land changes upstream first — in `.github`, `github-workflows`, and/or `repo-template`. Capture each squash-merge SHA.
2. **Version/tag update if needed.** When a `github-workflows` change must reach consumers, force-move the `v1` tag to the merge SHA:
   ```
   gh api -X PATCH repos/ArchonVII/github-workflows/git/refs/tags/v1 \
     -f sha=<merge-sha> -F force=true
   ```
   Verify with `gh api repos/ArchonVII/github-workflows/git/refs/tags/v1`. Anything depending on `@v1` now sees the new workflow.
3. **`archon-setup` snapshot refresh.** Pull provider `main` branches locally, then in `archon-setup`:
   ```
   git -C ../github-workflows pull
   git -C ../repo-template pull
   git -C ../.github pull
   npm run refresh-snapshots
   node --test 'test/*.mjs'
   ```
   Commit as `chore(snapshots): refresh after <upstream PRs>`. Open + merge the archon-setup PR.
4. **Update `ecosystem-status.md`.** This file. Move shipped items into Recently Completed, refresh in-flight PR state, record any decisions made.
5. **Issue cleanup / dedupe.** Close issues that the rollout resolved, dedup any stragglers, label what remains.

Notes:

- `scripts/refresh-snapshots.mjs` writes only `source`/`ref`/`sha`/`capturedAt`/`path` in `manifest.json`. Hand-added fields (e.g. `contents`) are dropped on refresh.
- For agent-managed code PRs in providers, do not self-merge (see [Owner Maintenance Lane decision](#decision-log)).
- The exemplar three-repo rollout is the v0.1.1 anomaly-triage capability (2026-05-13): `github-workflows#2 → 7fc2dea`, `repo-template#2 → bfc226d`, `archon-setup#2 → 29ba240`.

## Active workstreams

| `github-workflows` | Clean on main | `v1` now points at `00fbaab`, carrying node-ci cache manager auto-detection from PR #33 plus the prior F14/F7 workflow updates.                     |
| `archon-setup`     | In progress   | Snapshot refresh #59 records `github-workflows` `00fbaab`, `repo-template` `7aa1e91`, and `.github` `0717902`.                                    |
| `repo-template`    | Clean on main | Owner Maintenance Lane docs/hooks shipped in #22; propagation to generated repos is covered by the current `archon-setup` snapshots.               |
| `.github`          | Clean on main | Defaults snapshot is current at `0717902`; no separate provider PR is active.                                                                       |

Feature IDs come from the `docs/phase2/findings.md` numbering. Severity reflects the original finding.

## Backlog (prioritized)

1. **Complete `archon-setup` issue #59** — land the snapshot refresh for `github-workflows` PR #33 so generated repos record the current `@v1` provider SHA.
2. **Template walkthrough** — refresh PR template + issue forms + AGENTS.md against the new F2/F10 evidence shape and F7 owner-lane semantics. Single coordinated three-PR pass.
3. **F7 `.github` policy work** — finish `.github` #14 scoped policy now that the reusable workflow and template pieces are shipped.
4. **Branch-protection 400 anomaly** — file via the anomaly-triage workflow on next `archon-setup` PR. Reference fix already exists in `archon-setup/src/server/tasks/applyBaselineBranchProtection.mjs`.
5. **Events-stream rollout** — `.archon/events.jsonl` schema in `repo-template` AGENTS.md + `agent-workflow.events-stream` feature in `archon-setup`. Same three-PR pattern as anomaly-triage; renderer (status board UI inside archon-setup's local server) deferred to v0.2.

| 2026-05-17 | **Owner Maintenance Lane (F7).** Solo-dev policy of three lanes (Owner / Agent-managed / Default), enforced by path scope, not author identity. Owner lane allows direct `main` commits for add-only safe docs/images; agent-managed code PRs hard-block self-merge. | A universal self-merge block would prevent legitimate GitHub Desktop maintenance and can't distinguish agent from human commits under the same identity. |

## Parking lot

Ideas discussed but not yet planned:

- **Windows installer** for `archon-setup` (Inno Setup `.iss` + release-build workflow + Start Menu shortcut). Workstream B of v0.1.1; not started.
- **Status board UI** inside archon-setup's existing local server, rendering `.archon/events.jsonl`. Deferred to v0.2 once real events accumulate.
- **`rollout-playbooks/` subdirectory** — split out per-capability playbooks if more than one accumulates. Single inline playbook above is sufficient for now.
- **Re-enable `react/no-unescaped-entities`** in `comfyui-companion` after fixing the apostrophes in `web/src/{FilesBrowser,Groups}.tsx`.

## Updating this doc

This file is the canonical ecosystem status — but it's only as fresh as the last person who touched it. Update on:

- **Step 4 of every rollout** (mandatory).
- After any cross-repo decision (add a row to the Decision log).
- When any phase2 issue's status changes (Open → In flight → Shipped — row moves).
- When a new repo joins or leaves the ecosystem (update Topology, start/stop tracking).

Keep entries terse. Detail belongs in the relevant repo's `repo-update-log.md`, in the PR description, or in agent memory.
